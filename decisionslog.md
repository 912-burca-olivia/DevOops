### WEEK 1: Refactoring from python2 to python3
- did we use llms? any factors?

### WEEK 2: Refactoring app from python to another lang
- why go?
  builtin libs so we dont need so many dependancies
  *run /lookup a benchmark between python api and go api?

- why gorilla?
  seemed to be best option if refactoring from Flask
  
### WEEK 3: Integrating API and launching on server
- separating html endpoints from API endpoints 

### WEEK 4: 
- use docker hub token instead of password -> security
- github actions: simple to use, easily integrated to our project, common tool in industry
- cont integration OR cont deployment? TBC
- chose to make the release job separate to CD job
- pool resources as a team on digital ocean
- increased storage in server
- isolate DB from app, only API accesses it

### WEEK 5:
- going to add Volume to dockerfile so that DB updated locally from container
